<p>Interviewer: "Gun violence has recently been in the news, and many politicians have voiced their opinions on what to do to address the issue. What do you feel is the correct solution to this problem?"

Farmer: "It is my belief that the solution is absolutely not to take guns away from everybody,  that is my basic belief. I am more open on how to specifically counter today's issues with gun violence, however my preference is to make sure that only responsible gun owners and handlers can use them."

Interviewer: "The level of spending the federal government should have has been debated. What is your opinion on this matter?"

Farmer:  "Our government spends too much money on unnecessary projects and bloated, ineffective systems that only serve to cripple our economy, enrich government officials, and put us further in debt. We need to ensure that what we spend our money on is really worth it, and that we make sure our money gets to those as directly as possible."

Interviewer: "Abortion is one of the contentious issues of the day. How do you stand on the practice?"

Farmer: "The unborn are life as precious as any other; the radical left has had no qualms in pushing for the damaging practice of abortion on demand. Only in the cases of danger to the mother and rape should abortion be allowed."</p>
